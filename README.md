The shapefiles.zip file contain two shapefiles:
- bioregions.shp is a shapefile of all bioregions identified in the paper.
- transition.shp is a shapefile of all transitions areas.

You can download this zip file directly.

The script *mapping african bioregions.R* is useful if you want to load and map both shapefiles in R using the sf package.
